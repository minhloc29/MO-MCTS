The meanings of above inputs are: evaluated historical inputs and function values, the best optimal solution and corresponding maximum function values so far, the unobserved test input, the predicted mean and std of the function value at the unobserved test input, the cost spent when observing the test input, the budget has been used and the total given budget, respectively. The output is the utility value. All the inputs and output are torch.tensor with dtype=torch.float64. The input sizes are (n_train,dim), (n_train,1), (1,dim), (1), (n_test, dim), (n_test), (n_test), (n_test), (1), (1), respectively. The output size is (n_test). Here n_train is the number of evaluated samples, dim is the dimension of input variables, n_test is the number of test points. You must make sure the size of returned output utility_value is (n_test), so pay attention to the sizes of new variables you created in the code. Both input and output are torch tensors. You can use any mathematical operation on the inputs, please try to be creative and make full use of the inputs information.
