{task_prompt}

I have {algo_length} existing algorithms with their corresponding code as follows:  
{list_of_codes}

Your task is to create a new algorithm that is entirely different in form from the ones provided.

1. Begin by describing your new algorithm and its main steps in a single sentence. The description must be enclosed in double curly brackets {{}}.

2. Then, implement the new algorithm by completing the following Python function:  
{temp_func}

Do not include any additional explanations.
