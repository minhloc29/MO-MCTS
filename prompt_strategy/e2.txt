{task_prompt}

I have {algo_length} existing algorithms with their corresponding code as follows:  
{list_of_codes}

Please help me design a new algorithm that has a completely different structure from the provided ones, but may be inspired by them.

1. First, identify the common underlying idea or backbone shared by the given algorithms.  
2. Next, based on that backbone idea, describe your new algorithm in one sentence. The description must be enclosed in double curly brackets {{}}.  
3. Finally, implement the new algorithm by completing the following Python function:  
{temp_func}

Do not include any additional explanations.
