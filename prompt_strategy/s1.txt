{task_prompt}

I have {algo_length} existing algorithms with their corresponding code as follows:  
{list_of_codes}

Please help me design a new algorithm that is inspired by all the above algorithms, aiming to improve the Pareto front by achieving better overall trade-offs or dominating existing solutions.

1. Identify and list key ideas from the provided algorithms that clearly contribute to better performance across multiple objectives.

2. Based on those ideas, describe the design and main steps of your new algorithm in a single sentence. This description must be enclosed in braces {{}}.

3. Finally, implement the new algorithm by completing the following Python function:  
{temp_func}

Do not include any additional explanations.
