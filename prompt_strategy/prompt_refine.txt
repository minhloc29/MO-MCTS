{task_prompt}

Following is the Design Idea of a heuristic algorithm for the problem and the code with the function name '{func_name}' for implementing the heuristic algorithm.

{prompt_inout_inf} {prompt_other_inf}

Design Idea:
{algo_desc}

Code:
{code}

The content of the Design Idea may not fully represent what the algorithm actually does in detail.
Now, please re-describe the algorithm in no more than three sentences.

Hint: Reference the provided Design Idea and highlight the most critical aspects of the code. 
You may analyze which variables are given higher or lower priorities, explain the parameters used, and describe the structure of the algorithm.
